    "To see what this page would look like when there is _not_ an outage, you can [visit this book which was created beforehand](https://rlanzafame.github.io/my-first-book/main/some_content/text_and_code.html).\n",

    "- **Option 1:** Create a new book using the template, following the instructions at [github.com/teachbooks/template](https://github.com/teachbooks/template).\n",
    "- **Option 2:** Replace this page in the table of contents file (`_toc.yml`) with the file `text_and_code.ipynb`, then uncomment the lines in the config file (`_config.yml`) that are related to the interactive Python feature. Commit the changes in the GitHub repository of your book, and the GitHub Actions workflow should take care of the rest! This is explained in more detail on [this page in the TeachBooks Manual](https://teachbooks.io/manual/features/live_code.html).\n",
